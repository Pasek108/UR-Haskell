## About :dart:
These are my solutions to laboratory exercises carried out as part of the course "Języki i paradygmaty programowania" (Programming languages ​​and paradigms) in the Computer Science program at UR. 

The course covered the basics of the functional programming language Haskell and the logic programming language Prolog ([UR-Prolog](https://github.com/Pasek108/UR-Prolog)). The acquired knowledge was tested in the form of a practical test.
